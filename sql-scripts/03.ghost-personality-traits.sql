You''ll hear less footsteps when a Wraith is around, so if you''ve heard a conspicuous absence of these, you may have one on your hands. NOTE: Just because a Ghost walked into a wall and vanished does not mean that it''s a Wraith. This is a graphical bug and does not rule the Wraith in or out as a suspect.'::text
